# Dependencies

[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - JavaScript transpiler that converts ES6 to plain vanilla JavaScript.

[babel-eslint](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint) - Lints Babel code not supported by ESLint.

[babel-polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-polyfill.html) - Provides polyfills necessary for a full ES2015+ environment on different browsers.

[babel-preset-env](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-preset-env) - Babel preset that transforms ES2015+ down to ES5. Automatically determines the Babel plugins and polyfills you need based on targeted browser or runtime.

[babel-preset-react](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-react/) - Babel preset that transforms JSX into createElement calls.

[cross-env](https://github.com/kentcdodds/cross-env) - Cross-operating system environment scripts. Windows command prompts can't parse `NODE_ENV=production` due to a difference between how Windows and POSIX handle `env` variables.

[dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) = Loads environment variables from `.env` file into `process.env`. This allows storing environment configurations separate from the code.

[Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Minimal Node.js framework.

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - Real-time NoSQL database that lets you store and sync JSON data in real-time between users. 

[normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) - Renders elements consistently across browsers.

[React](https://reactjs.org/) - Webpack plugin for Babel.

[ReactDOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html) - Provides DOM-specific methods and renders React components.

[react-modal](https://github.com/reactjs/react-modal) - Accessible modal dialog component for React.

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/) - JavaScript module bundler and task runner. Can also be used to transform and package just about any asset. Emits a single file `bundle.js`.

[Webpack DevServer](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) - A developvement server using Webpack that provides live reloading.


# Webpack Plugins
[babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader) - Transpiles JS files using Babel and Webpack.

[babel-plugin-transform-class-properties](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-class-properties/) - Babel plugin for transforming class properties so there is no longer need to bind the `this` context with `this.someHandler = this.someHandler.bind(this);`. Current class syntax for JavaScript only allows you to define methods inside the class but not properties. This plugin enables properties.

[css-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader) - Resolves `@import` statements like `import/require()`.

[mini-css-extract-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin) - Used to extract CSS from bundle into a separate CSS file.

[node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) - Provides Node binding to LibSass, the CSS preprocessor written in C. 

[sass-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader) - Compiles SASS into CSS using `node-sass`. Requires `node-sass` and `webpack` as peer dependencies.
